The Veritaseum Crowd Sale Token

The VeritaseumToken is an ERC20 compliant Ethereum token, with added features to enable a Crowdsale Initial Coin Offer (ICO).
The code-base makes use of Zeppelin and its standard templates, Safemath and other standard solidity best practices.

Usage of the Veritaseum Token:

 - Simple send Ether to the Smart contract during the Initial Coin Offering period
 - VeritaseumToken will create and allocate new tokens to the address from which the Ether was send, according the the set and prevailing rate (as per the price global variable in the Smart Contract)
 - Use, sell or transfer your tokens on any compatible exchange such as [EtherDelta](https://etherdelta.github.io/)

The token sale works on a sliding scale with the following rules:

 - This ICO starts on 2017 April 25, 09:30 am, EST
 - The ICO runs for 31 days
 - Day one offers a 20% discount
 - Day two offers a 10% discount
 - After which the discount will reduce by 1% per day until full price is reached
 - Only 51% of the total supply of tokens will be sold during ICO with the rest allocated for future usuage as well as for pre-ICO token holders

Tokens are non-refundable, even if the minimum target is not reached.
